=TITLE MongoDB Package

=SUBTITLE Package using mongod server for storage and retrieval of data


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package holds a set of modules which will help you accessing a MongoDB
server. All primitive functions are installed to insert, update, find and remove
documents.


=head1 MODULES

=head2 MongoDB::Connection

Module to connect to server and to get basic information. See
L<pod file|MongoDB/Connection.pod>.

=head2 MongoDB::DataBase

Module to handle specific database tasks.

=head2 MongoDB::DataBase::Authenticate

Module to authenticate users.

=head2 MongoDB::DataBase::Users

Module to administer user accounts.

=head2 MongoDB::Collection

Module to perfoem the standard CRUD operations. See
L<pod file|MongoDB/Collection.pod>.

=head2 MongoDB::Cursor

Module to iterate through found data search for by methods from the
C<MongoDB::Collection> module.

=head2 MongoDB::DBRef

Module to handle references between documents.

=head2 MongoDB::Protocol

Module to define a role used by classes C<MongoDB::Collection> and C<MongoDB::Cursor>
to have access to an instantiated wire class.

=head2 MongoDB::Wire

Module for which its methods access the C<BSON> encoding methods are used
before sending and decoding tools after receiving data from the server.

=head2 MongoDB

Module to hold basic information reachable from other modules.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Module MongoDB depends on Module C<BSON> and C<Digest::MD5>.


=head1 SEE ALSO

The MongoDB site at L<http://www.mongodb.org/>


=head1 TODO

There is a lot still to be implemented. A non exhaustive list of todo's:

=for item1
Mongo priority recomendations. Following L<priority
recomendations|http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/mongodb-driver-requirements/>
from the mongodb site about writing drivers.

=for item1
Speed, protocol correctness and clear code are priorities for now.

=for item2
Speed can be influenced by specifying types on all variables. Also setting
constraints like (un)definedness etc on parameters. Most of it is already done.

=for item2
Furthermore the speedup of the language perl6 itself would have more impact than
the programming of a several month student(me) can accomplish ;-). As of
september 2015 a great improvement is made.
