        MongoDB is a $*citation[NoSQL] database which uses $*citation[BSON] to 
        store and load information in a database. With the mongodb package a
        shell program called mongo is available to give instructions to a
        mongodb server.

      $para [ To work with data on the server from within a program a driver is
        needed. There are drivers for many program languages. This document
        introduces a driver for the Perl6 language. In the perl6 ecosystem,
        which might grow into a cpan like system later, there are two packages
        needed to work with the driver. These are $*citation[MongoDB] and
        BSON.
