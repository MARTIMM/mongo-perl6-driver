# Reference

Here you can find all documentation about all modules but not all of them are of interest to the user. The user might only be interested in **MongoDB::Client**, **MongoDB::Database**, **MongoDB::Collection** and **MongoDB::Cursor**. The rest is for me to remember what I did and what it is used for ;-) Of course you're free to examine it too if you're interested.

P.s. It only needs to grow a bit â€¦
