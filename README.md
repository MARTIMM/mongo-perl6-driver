# MongoDB Driver

![Leaf](http://modules.perl6.org/logos/MongoDB.png)

## DOCUMENTATION

Plenty of documents can be found on the MongoDB site

* [MongoDB Driver Requirements](http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/mongodb-driver-requirements/)
* [Feature Checklist for MongoDB Drivers](http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/feature-checklist-for-mongodb-drivers/)

* [Database commands](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command)
* [Administration Commands](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/nav-administration/)

* [Mongo shell methods](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method)
* [Collection methods](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/js-collection/)
* [Cursor methods](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/)

* [Authentication](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/authentication/)
* [Create a User Administrator](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/add-user-administrator/)


Documentation about this driver can be found in doc/Original-README.md and the
following pod files

* lib/MongoDB.pod
* lib/MongoDB/Collection.pod
* lib/MongoDB/Connection.pod
* lib/MongoDB/Cursor.pod
* lib/MongoDB/Database.pod

When you have *Pod::To::HTML* installed and the pdf generator *wkhtmltopdf* then
you can execute the pod file with perl6 to generate a pdf from the pod document.

```
$ which wkhtmltopdf
... displays some path ...
$ panda --installed list | grep Pod::To::HTML
Pod::To::HTML   [installed]
$ cd lib/MongoDB
$ chmod u+x Connection.pod
$ Connection.pod
...
or
$ perl6 Connection.pod
...
```

## INSTALLING THE MODULES

Use panda to install the package like so. BSON will be installed as a
dependency.

```
$ panda install MongoDB
```

## Versions of PERL, MOARVM and MongoDB

* Perl6 version ```2015.07.1-182-g5ba44fc```
* MoarVM version ```2015.07-108-g7e9f29e```
* MongoDB version ```3.0.5```

Maybe we also need to test other versions of mongodb such as 2.6.* and provide
functionality for it. This will make it a bit slower caused by tests on version
and act on it but it is not on all methods nessesary.


## FEATURE CHECKLIST FOR MONGODB DRIVERS

There are lists on the MongoDB site see references above. Items from the list
below will be worked on. There are many items shown here, it might be impossible
to implement it all. By using run_command(), much can be accomplished. A lot of the
items are using that call to get the information for you. Also quite a few items
are shown in in more than one place place. Removed all internal commands.

## BUGS, KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND TODO

Although the lists above represent one hell of a todo, below are a few notes
which I have to make to remember to add items to programmed functions. There
are also items to be implemented in BSON. You need to look there for info

* Following [priority recomendations](http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/mongodb-driver-requirements/) from the mongodb site about writing drivers.
* Speed, protocol correctness and clear code are priorities for now.
  * Speed can be influenced by specifying types on all variables
  * Furthermore the speedup of the language perl6 itself would have more impact
    than the programming of a one month student(me) can accomplish ;-)
* Change die() statements to throw exception objects to notify caller.
* Keys must be checked for illegal characters when inserting documents.
* Tests for connection to non existing server. timeout setting.
* Test to compare documents
* Test group aggregation keyf field and finalize
* Test map reduce aggregation more thoroughly.
* Map_reduce, look into scope. argument is not used.
* Explain changed after mongodb 3.0
* Testing $mod in queries seems to have problems in version 3.0.5
* Get info about multiple accounts instead of one at the time
* Need a change in throwing exceptions. Not all errors are unrecoverable. Return
  e.g. a failure instead of die with an exception.
* Modify Mongo.pm. Remove use statements and add variables for use by modules.
* While we can add users to the database we cannot authenticate due to the lack
  of supported modules in perl 6. E.g. I'd like to have SCRAM-SHA1 to
  authenticate with. 

## CHANGELOG

See [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Please note point 4. on
that page: *Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may
change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.*

* 0.25.1
  * Installed a sandbox to start mongod in. Now no problems can occur with user
    databases and collections when testing. The sandbox is made in
    t/000-mk-sandbox.t and broken down in 999-rm-sandbox.t. This setup also
    helps in testing replication and sharding.
  * Changed top module ```MongoDB```. Originally there are use statements to
    load other modules in. Modules are changed later in such a way that modules
    needed to be loaded in other modules as well and then it will be some
    overhead of loading the modules twice or more. So I want to clean these
    statements from the module. Now the user can decide for himself what he
    needs. Not all modules are always needed and some are loaded by others. E.g.
    ```MongoDB::Document::Users``` is needed only to add or remove accounts.
    Furthermore when a connection is made using ```MongoDB::Connection```,
    ```MongoDB::Database``` will be available because it needs to create a
    database for you. Because ```MongoDB::Database``` is then loaded,
    ```MongoDB::Collection``` is then loaded too because a database must be able
    to create a collection.
  * get_users() to get info about all users.
  * Use version 3.* type of config (in YAML) for sandbox setup.

* 0.25.0
  * Create user
  * Drop user
  * Drop all users
  * Users info
  * Grant roles
  * Revoke roles
  * Update users

  * Refactored code from Database to Database::Users
* 0.24.1
  * Added document checks to inserts. No dollars on first char of keys and no
    dots in keys. This is checked on all levels. On top level the key ```_id```
    is checked if the value is unique in te collection.
  * Changes in code caused by upgrading from MongoDB 2.4 to 3.0.5. Many of the
    servers return messages were changed.
* 0.24.0
  * Added version() and build_info() to MongoDB::Connection.
* 0.23.2
  * Added error processing in Cursor::count(). Throws X::MongoDB::Cursor
    exception.
* 0.23.1
  * Changes caused by rakudo update
  * BIG PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! Should have seen this comming! Its about run_command().
    A hash needs to be setup with therein a command to be processed. With the new
    rakudo the hash get hashed properly and the keys are now in some unpredictable
    order. One of the nessessities of run_command is that the command is found at
    the first key value pair. During encoding into a BSON byte array the command
    can be placed anywhere in the string and some other option comming at the
    first location will be seen as the command.
    SOLVED; Hashes work like hashes... mongodb run_command needs command on
    first key value pair. Because of this a few multi methods in several modules
    are added to process Pair arrays instead of hashes.
* 0.23.0
  * Added find_and_modify(), stats(), data_size() methods in Collection.
* 0.22.6
  * Changes in testfiles to read in the proper module instead of the MongoDB
    module which will include all modules. Most of the time it is enaugh to
    use the Connection module only.
* 0.22.5 Changes to packaging and adding more typing information
* 0.22.4 Changes because of modifications in BSON
* 0.22.3 Upgraded Rakudo * and bugfix in Protocol.pm
* 0.22.2 Bugfixes in use of javascript
* 0.22.1 Add use of BSON::Javascript in group() and map_reduce().
* 0.22.0 map_reduce() in MongoDB::Collection.
* 0.21.0 group() in MongoDB::Collection.
* 0.20.0 list_collections() and collection_names() in MongoDB::Database
         hint() on a cursor.
* 0.19.0 explain() in MongoDB::Collection and MongoDB::Cursor.
* 0.18.0 count() in MongoDB::Collection
         distinct() in MongoDB::Collection
* 0.17.1 Collectionnames are checked. In perl dashes are possible and are also
         accepted by the server. In the mongo shell however it is not possible
         to manipulate these names because it works in a javascript
         environment which wil see it as a substraction operator. Perhaps
         other things will go wrong too such as running javascript on the
         server. It is now tested against m/^ <[\$ _ A..Z a..z]> <[.\w _]>+ $/.
         Note the '$', It is accepted because the collection $cmd is sometimes
         used to get information from. create_collection() will also check the
         collection name but will not accept the '$'.
* 0.17.0 create_collection() to MongoDB::Database
         X::MongoDB::Database Exception
* 0.16.1 Cleanup databases at the end of tests. Documented tests what is tested
* 0.16.0 Name change X::MongoDB::LastError into X::MongoDB::Collection.
         Added drop_indexes() drop() get_indexes() to MongoDB::Collection.
* 0.15.0 Added drop_index() to MongoDB::Collection.
* 0.14.1 Bugfixes find_one(), ensure_index(). Added Class X::MongoDB::LastError
         and used when ensure_index() fails.
* 0.14.0 ensure_index() in MongoDB::Collection
* 0.13.7 Changes depending on BSON
* 0.13.6 MongoDB::Cursor pod document
* 0.13.0 Added next() to MongoDB::Cursor.
* 0.12.0 Added count() to MongoDB::Cursor.
* 0.11.1 Added Connection.pod and Collection.pod.
* 0.11.0 Added methods to get error status in MongoDB::Database.
* 0.10.0 Added drop() in MongoDB::Database to drop a database.
* 0.9.0 Added list_databases() and database_names() to MongoDB::Connection
* 0.8.0 run_command() added to MongoDB::Database
* 0.7.4 bugfix return values in MongoDB::Cursor
* 0.7.3 bugfix return values in MongoDB::Protocol
* 0.7.2 extended signatures for return values
* 0.7.1 find extended with return_field_selector
* 0.6.1 add tests for insert(@docs)
* 0.6.0 switched to semantic versioning
* 0.5 compatibility fixes for Rakudo Star 2014.12
